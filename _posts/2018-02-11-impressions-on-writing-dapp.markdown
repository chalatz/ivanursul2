Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain...things, that became very popular in recent years. By the time of writing this article I found out that there is around [1400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies) cryptocurrencies in the world. Most of them are a complete rubbish, without any value and trust. Some of them are systemic currencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with big market [capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/). 

You may ask yourself - why do people need 1400 cryptocurrencies? Well, most of them aren't actual currencies. Most of them are so called [dapps](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/dapps/) - decentralized applications, that user blockchain for their needs. Usually, they are hosted on top of some infrastructual blockchains. Today, the most popular one is  [project Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) - A platform, which allows to write decentralized applications.

I wanted to understand for myself the status of this technology. Is it ready for start being used worldwide? Can software engineers start forgetting about traditional centric approach and move to the blockchain? The short answer is - no. The long answer - I prepared an article, which consist of step-by-step instructions about how to write and maintan DAPP, my impressions and general info you should know before starting yet another world cryptocurrency.

I spent quite some time to understand Blockchain and I have a lot of thoughts about this technology, so I want to warn you, the article is going to be big and informative, it will contain a lot of my opinion and you may not agree with it. As usual, feel free to express your ideas under the article, in the comments sections.

### <a href="#" name=""><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Blockchain. How it differs from a traditional approach?

From the beginning of civilazation, humans wanted to centralize things. Ancient people used to have [barter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter) for exchanging things. After some time, they realized that it can complicate things a lot, because they had to keep in mind a table of exchanges, in order to know how much meat should be exchanged for a wheat. Of course, the exchange operation was not accurate, that's why people invented money. To be more correct, some ancient empire invented money, proclaiming that now people should use it for buying and selling things. It was one of the most historical centralization we had in our history. From that period, there was a facility for producing money, and it was the only place, which had rights to produce them. Starting from that point, civilization learnt that centralization is the right thing.

Nowadays, we started to rethink how centralization affects our everyday life. Some time ago, enthusiastic people started to think how to built a non-centralized infrastructure. They ended up with building [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) - a structure(or database), that is stored on each node, secured cryptographically. This structure initiated a new era of decentralised approach of storing data. [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) was the pioneer of the industry. Founded by mysterious [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto), it soon became the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. 

Right after Bitcoin, a lot of other blockchain projects were released. Second most valuable project is Ethereum. Its idea is not about sending and receiving money. [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin), who is a programmer, wanted to have a way of running his applications inside blockchain. So he invented an infrastructure blockchain, where now everyone can create his applicatio and people can use it.

What arguments can people find to love decentralized approach? And why they start to hate centric approach afterwards? Well, everything is about transparency. Open-source cryptographic algorithms let people think that algorithm can be more reliable than a central bank. Just because the algrithm is open-sourced, everyone can see it and everyone can inspect it. Comparing with traditional approach of making physical money, we see that people don't have such transparency: central bank can once decide to print more money, which will cause bigger inflation and people will become poorer. That's one of the reasons people will continue to love Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  

The technical idea of the blockchain looks very trustworthy: no central place to store data, everything is transparent, people see how the data goes from and to their wallets. Additionally, there are folks called miners, who are calculating your transactions for you. Everything looks great, isn't it?

### <a href="#" name=""><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Limitations

We can't speak about Blockchain without knowing its dark side. Of course, this technology is not perfect. Even though we now see that third generation of Blockchain cryptocurrencies are coming, they all still have the same problems.

* Can't redeploy application.
* People can loose their money/tokens
* Speed of the blockchain. Can't scale well, Kitty application example.
* Publicity is not always a good option for storing your data. Sia example, encrypted files are stored on some computers. You need to be a real expert to understand that your data won't be stolen.
* Clients pay for the actions/operations/transactions
*

The traditional, centric approach states to have a server, where you host your application. Thus, you have a physical server, which may run on your data center or can be located in the cloud, and you know what
