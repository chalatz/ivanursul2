<p>
    You are about to subscribe to my blog. From my side, I promise to use your email only for notifying you about new articles and researches.

    I write articles mostly about java and world around, but you may have a chance to read something completely different.

    Last one, it's up to you to decide whether my blog is useful for you or not. The only thing I'd like to ask - no matter what opinion you have, good or bad, always share it in comments section. Thank you ;)
