### How to hire me
You can hire me as a software engineer or consultant for your project. In case you have a small amount of work, you can hire me using [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01773bdc595f0cec47) platform. Alternatively, if you have a big project and don't want to pay rates to Upwork, we can open a direct contract.

### If you need a team
Recently I founded [Jastics Labs](https://jastics.com/), a software development company. Feel free to [send](https://jastics.com/hire) a brief message to us with an explanation of what you need.
